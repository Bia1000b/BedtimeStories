        <h2><img src="/Pictures/img-emperor.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="img-emperor">The Emperor's New Clothes</h2>

         <p>Once upon a time, there was a vain and silly Emperor who ruled the land. The Emperor loved clothing more than anything else. He ignored the duties of ruling the country and spent most of his time buying new suits of clothes, 
             trying them on, and having official parades in which he showed off his clothes.</p>
        
         <p>The Emperor's vanity was known far and wide across the land. Two scoundrels from a distant town heard about the silly Emperor and devised a clever plan to fool him.
              The scoundrels made a loom from wood and went to the Emperor pretending to be weavers and tailors. </p>
        <p>The scoundrels told the Emperor: "We know a secret way to make a magical, golden cloth that is the most beautiful cloth ever created. The patterns are so intricate that they will make you swoon with disbelief.
             And the fabric is as light a feather. But, this incredible cloth is only visible to people who are wise and worthy; it is fit only for rulers who are worthy of their office -- fools cannot even see this magical cloth. If you would like, Sire, we could weave you some of this magic cloth and make you a suit of clothes that is suitable for a man of your distinction. It will take us a week." </p>
        
        <p>The Emperor said: "Yes, of course I want a suit made from this magical cloth. You must begin at once." </p>
        
        <p> The Emperor ran off and began planning a parade to show off the new outfit he would soon have. Soon the whole town was excited about the Emperor's new magical suit of clothes. </p> 
        
         <p>The crooks gave the Emperor's men a list of supplies they would need, including many chests full of gold and spools of fine silk thread. After the gold and silk arrived, the scoundrels set up their loom in a room in the castle and pretended to weave, using make-believe invisible thread.</p>
        
         <p>After a few days, the Emperor sent his Prime Minister to check on the progress of the weavers. The Prime Minister entered the room but couldn't see any magical thread or magical cloth. The scoundrels were busy measuring and cutting and sewing the invisible cloth. The Prime Minister was very upset about this and was afraid that he must be a fool and unworthy of his office because he couldn't see the magical cloth. 
            When he reported back to the Emperor, he lied and said that the magical fabric had a pattern so beautiful that no words that could describe it and that the colors were brighter than a rainbow. The Emperor was very happy and could hardly wait for his new suit.</p>
        
        <p>In a few more days, the Emperor's new suit was finished. The Emperor and his men happily entered the room. Neither the Emperor nor his men could see the magical clothing. But each person was afraid to admit it because that would mean he was foolish and unworthy of his position.
             So everyone said that the clothes were beautiful and amazing, even though no one could see a thing.</p>

        <p>The scoundrels told the Emperor to undress, and he did. Then the crooks pretended to dress him in the magical clothes. They carefully dressed the Emperor in the invisible pants, shirt, and cloak. 
            When they were done, each of the Emperor's men congratulated him on his beautiful new suit, and the Emperor nodded in agreement -- but the Emperor was only wearing his underwear.</p>

        <p>The Emperor and his men left the castle and headed the parade that was walking through the town. He was very proud of his new, magical suit. At first, people gasped when they saw a nearly-naked Emperor walking through the town.
             Then they remembered that only fools couldn't see these magical clothes, so they began cheering and congratulating the Emperor on a magnificent suit of clothes.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, one small child spoke the truth. She pointed at the Emperor and said, "The Emperor is only wearing his underwear." Everyone in the crowd gasped. They knew it was true, and all cried out, "The Emperor is only wearing his underwear."
             The Emperor turned red with embarrassment but wouldn't admit that he had been fooled. He continued with the silly parade and eventually went back to his castle, where he put on some clothes.</p>

        <p>The moral of the story:
            Think for yourself. Don't be pressured or scared into going along with things that you know aren't right. </p>
        
        <p>The End.</p>
