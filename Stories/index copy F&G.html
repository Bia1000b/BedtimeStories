         <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. 
             The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p>
        
         <p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way.
              So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. </p>
        <p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p>
        
        <p>"What a fool I am," he said.
             "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for." </p>
        
        <p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>
        
        <p>Moral of the story:There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.</p> 
        
        <p>The End.</p>
