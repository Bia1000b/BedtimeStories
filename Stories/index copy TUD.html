         <p>On a farm long ago, a Mama Duck sat on her nest.  “How long must I wait for my babies to hatch?” she said.  “I have to sit here all alone! And no one comes to visit me.”  But what could she do? A Mama duck must keep her eggs warm till they hatch.</p>
           <p> At last, the eggs began to crack.  One by one, yellow ducklings stepped out of their shells.  They shook their wings and said, “Quack, quack!”</p>
           <p> “Look at all of you!” said Mama Duck with joy.  “You are all so cute!”</p>
            <p> “Quack, quack!” they said.</p>
           <p> Mama Duck said, “Come and line up.  We will go down to the lake for your very first swim.”  She counted – one, two, three, four, five. “Oh dear!” she said.  “I should have six ducklings!”
            But one large egg was still in the nest. “Well," said Mama Duck, "it looks like that big egg will take more time.” So she had to go sit on her nest again and wait some more.</p>
            
            <p>The next day, the big egg started to hatch.  Out came a baby boy bird. But if one may say so, it was an odd-looking thing.  This bird was much bigger than others. He was not yellow at all - he was dark-gray from his head to his feet.  And he walked with a funny wobble.</p>
            <p> One of the yellow ducklings pointed.  “What is THAT? He cannot be one of us!”</p> 
            <p>“I have never seen such an ugly duckling!” said another.</p>
            <p>“How can you say such a thing?” said Mama Duck in a stern voice. “You are only one day old!  Your brother hatched from the very same nest as you did. Now line up. We will go to the lake for your very first swim.”
            Yet the other ducklings quacked, “Ugly!  Ugly! Ugly!” The Ugly Duckling did not know why the other ducklings were yelling at him.  He took the last spot in the line.</p>
            <p>Each yellow duck jumped in the river and swam behind Mama Duck.  When it was his turn, the Ugly Duckling jumped in and started to paddle, too.  “At least he can swim,” Mama Duck said to herself.</p>
           <p>When they left the water and started to play, the Ugly Duckling tried to play with his brothers and sisters, too.  They yelled, “Go away! We will not play with you! You are ugly. And you walk weird, too!”</p> 
             
            <p>When Mama Duck was close by, she would not let them talk in this way.  “Be nice!” she would scold. But she was not always close by.</p>
            <p> One day, one of the yellow ducklings said to the Ugly Duckling, “You know what?  You would do us a big favor if you just went away from here!” All of them started to quack, “Get out!  Get out! Get out!”</p>
            <p>“Why won’t they let me stay here?” said the Ugly Duckling to himself.  He hung his head down low. “Ah, they are right. I should go.”</p>
            
            <p>Soon he found a new lake.  Looking into the water, the Ugly Duckling saw the reflection of a flock of large white birds flying.  He looked overhead and could not believe what he saw. There, above him, were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen!  Their long white bodies and slender necks seemed to just glide through the sky.</p>
            <p>“I am so tired!” he said, paddling with all his might.</p> 
            <p>He heard quiet splashing sounds behind him, and turned around.  A flock of those beautiful birds landed behind him on the water.</p> 
            <p>“Do not worry!” he said to them, holding out one wing.  “I will go now. I will not make trouble for you.” A big fat tear rolled down his cheek.  He turned to go away. When he opened his eyes, he saw a reflection in the water of one of those beautiful white birds.  Why was it so close to him? He jumped back. And the reflection jumped back, too.</p> 
            <p>“Why are you going so soon?” said one of the beautiful birds.  </p> 
            <p>“Stay here, with us!” said another.  “We’ll be great friends.”</p> 
            <p>Then, the bird who used to be the Ugly Duckling knew what had happened!  He was not an duck, he was a beautiful swan, and that's why he was so different from everyone.</p> 
            <p>“Say!” he said, swimming towards the stunning birds.  “Who’s an ugly duckling now? Surely, Not I!” </p>
