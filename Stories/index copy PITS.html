         <p>Once there was a party in heaven and they told me it was like this:</p>
        
         <p>The birds organized a party in the sky and invited all the animals on earth. But of course only the animals with feathers could go because they could fly.
              The birds spent days getting ready for the party, adjusting and preening their colorful feathers. </p>

        <p>The tortoise, however, poor thing, was dying to see heaven and thought she was going to a party too.</p>
        
        <p>The animals commented, "The tortoise must be crazy!"
             And they asked, "How do you go to the party in heaven, tortoise?" And she, in that calm, "Flying, flying..." </p>
        
        <p>Finally, the day of the party arrived and all the birds flew to the sky.
             And the tortoise just stood there looking at the sky, wanting and wishing...</p>
        
        <p>The vulture, feeling sorry for the tortoise, had an idea (it was he who was going to liven up a party in heaven by playing his guitar).
             He placed the tortoise inside the hole of the guitar. Then the tortoise and the vulture soared happily to heaven.</p> 
        
         <p>Heaven was filled with all kinds of entertainment: lots of food, lots of drinks, lots of dancing and singing. The tortoise was overwhelmed with happiness. 
             When she saw the earth from above, she was delighted. And she had a lot of fun: she ate and drank and danced and sang...</p>
        
         <p>But, as all good things usually do, the party came to an end. It was time to go home. 
             And the tortoise jumped into the hole in the vulture's guitar, and they flew back to earth.</p>
        
        
         <p> However, the vulture was very tired. He had sung and played all night. When passing through a very dark cloud,
              the vulture's eyes closed and he took a quick nap, long enough not to notice that his guitar had turned upside down. Poor tortoise fell from above. 
              The poor thing was dying of fear and screamed as she plummeted towards the ground. The poor thing hit the ground..</p>
        
        <p>The tortoise's luck was that it fell facedown. The hull shattered and was a shard of hull all over the place. The tortoise stayed there, poor thing, scared, shrunken.
             The tortoise lie motionless in the grass. When the sun rose, the animals saw the poor thing there, shrunken and full of fear. Despite looking dead, they realized that she was alive. So they all ached with compassion for their friend.
              Each one looked around and took a small piece of the hull that was scattered everywhere. And they glued one by one, with great care and affection. The tortoise was happy. And the animals too.</p>
        
        <p>And that's why even today the tortoise's shell is so well patched.</p>

        <p>The End.</p>
